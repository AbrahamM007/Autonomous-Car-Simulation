<h1>Autonomous Car Simulation Powered by Neural Network AI</h1>
Experience a browser-based simulation where virtual cars learn to drive autonomously along a road. The system trains each car using a custom neural network, enabling it to avoid traffic and stay within lane boundaries using real-time sensor input.

<h3>ðŸ“˜ Core JavaScript Concepts Demonstrated</h3>
Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)
Modular code with ES6 classes (e.g., Car, Sensor, NeuralNetwork)
Includes constructors, private methods (#method()), and inheritance

Encapsulation & Private Methods
Uses modern JS syntax (e.g., #createPolygon, #move) for encapsulated functionality

Canvas API
Dynamic rendering of roads, vehicles, sensors, and neural networks
Transformations (rotate/translate) simulate real car movement

Animation Loop
Smooth updates via requestAnimationFrame()
Responsive canvas sizing (canvas.height = window.innerHeight)

Collision Detection
Geometry-based using polygons and intersection checks (getIntersection(), polysIntersect())

AI & Neural Network Design
Custom feedforward architecture with tunable weights and biases
Inputs: sensor data; Outputs: directional controls
Threshold-based activation (sum > bias ? 1 : 0)
Includes mutation-based learning with NeuralNetwork.mutate()

Ray Casting for Sensors
Each sensor casts rays to detect obstacles and road edges
Intersection logic determines object distances

User Interaction
Interface buttons for saving/loading top-performing neural networks via localStorage

Functional Programming Concepts
Use of .map(), .forEach(), .find(), and spread syntax for streamlined logic

<h3>ðŸ§® Neural Network Architecture</h3>
Structure: Inputs â†’ Hidden Layer â†’ Outputs

Example: 5 sensor inputs â†’ 6 hidden neurons â†’ 4 outputs (forward, left, right, reverse)

Function: Output nodes directly control vehicle movement

Learning: Hard-threshold activation, evolving through generations with mutations to enhance driving behavior
